      "text_1":"Part One - section 2 concerns the definition of hatred",
      "text_2": "'hatred' means hatred against a person or a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their protected characteristics or any one of those characteristics’",
      "text_3": "The term 'hatred' is not defined in the Bill and is a word that can have a different meaning depending on how an act, word or thought is perceived. During the Dail debates Hate is described as ‘hatred’ or any act that creates hate.This is the only definition that was cited, it is not a definition but vague and open to interpretation. This meaningless play on words depends on the emotions of the party who perceives ‘hate’ rather than an objective meaning of the word hate.",
      "text_4": "This vague interpretation can result in the ordinary citizen not knowing if they committed a crime by inadvertently hurting someone's feelings. It can also be used to shut down debate and criticism of the government if legitimate concerns by the public cannot be aired.",
      "text_6": "Part Two -10 is concerned with the possesion of material that is hateful",
      "text_7":"A person may be deemed guilty of a criminal act if they possess material that a member of a protected group may not like and perceive as hateful. ",
      "text_8":"The previous Hate Bill Act 1989 made a criminal act motivated by hate a harsher crime. The new Hate Bill includes the incentment enhancements of the 1989 Hate Bill to include speech as a criminal offence. This bill does not protect groups of minorities, instead it clamps down on democracy and the ability of a citizen to freely think and speak. It gives the government and institutions of the state the arbitrary power to curtail innate freedoms.",
      "text_9":"Powers of Search and seizure",
      "text_10":"In the case of material that is deemed ‘Hateful’. The type of material is not defined, and is left open to interpretation. In the past the onus was on the prosecution to prove that the accused intended to distribute material. With possession of material which is not clearly defined the accused, who may merely have a mime or joke on their  phone or computer can be deemed as having committed a criminal offence.",
      "text_11":"This power given to the Gardai to search an accused's home and digital devices may be seen as Government overreach, a refusal to permit a search also leads the accused to commit a crime ",

    "text_7": "The Government proposes on deleting the wording on 'which the Family is founded' in Article 41.3.1 ",
    "text_8": "The wording durable relationships is not defined and is open to being interpretated erroneously",
    "text_10": "Problamatic details, such as how long a relationship should be before it is considered durable, as the meaning durable is not defined on length of time, does 'durable' mean weeks, months, years...",

    "text_1": "In Article 41.2.1° “In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.”",
    "text_6": "In Article 41.2.2° “The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.”",
    "text_3": "These articles together protect the position of a woman as caregiver in the home and protects a woman who is a caregiver with small children from the necessity of working for economic reasons ",
    "text_4": "The government proposes to delete these protections and replace these Articles with a new Article: 'The State recognises that the provision of care, by members of a family to one another by reason of the bonds that exist among them, gives to Society a support without which the common good cannot be achieved, and shall strive to support such provision.' ",
    "text_5": "This change could be problematic as the wording 'strive to support' may be an opt-out for the Government to 'endeavour to ensure'.",
    "text_6": "Perhaps the Government to follow the exact meaning of the constitution, 'to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour', should value the work that a woman undertakes in caring for her children or other family members should adequately compensates her.",
