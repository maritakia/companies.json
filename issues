It will provide qualifying businesses with up to 40% of the increase in electricity or gas bills up to €10,000 per month. It will help small businesses the most, but also medium and larger businesses. The second initiative is a €200 million targeted Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme  designed to assist viable but vulnerable businesses that are suffering the broader effects of the war in Ukraine. Operating in tandem with the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will make up to €500 million in low-cost investment loans of up to ten years available to SMEs, including farmers and fishers with no collateral required for loans up to €500,000. A minimum of 30% of the lending volume will be targeted towards environmental sustainability purposes.",
