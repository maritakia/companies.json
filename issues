  "explainer":"An Act to impose certain prohibitions and restrictions with respect to the investment by the National Treasury Management Agency of the assets of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund in undertakings which appear on the UN Database of companies operating in illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land. To require the Agency to ensure that such assets are not invested in such an undertaking ISIF has invested Irish taxpayers' money in nine companies operating in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. (The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, was established in late 1990 to manage the assets and liabilities of the Irish Government. Part of its brief is to manage Ireland's National Pension Reserve Fund and the Irish national debt. It also has responsibility for the management of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund).",

This bill would allow for a commission of investigation to be set up in this State that would be allowed to compel witnesses in the South of Ireland. It would have the power to take evidence from people outside the State. It also would have the power to consider information collected from other published state investigations from outside of the southern State.",
