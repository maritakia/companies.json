New figures released to the party’s housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin by Finance Minister Michael McGrath found that between 2017 and 2023, the scheme has cost the State nearly €1bn. The Help to Buy scheme is an incentive for first-time buyers which allows them to €30,000 of their own tax back towards the purchase of a newly built home. In 2017, just €69.4m was claimed under Help to Buy. This increased to €73.5m, €101.1m and €120.4m in 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively. The Help to Buy scheme is an incentive for first-time buyers which allows them to €30,000 of their own tax back towards the purchase of a newly built home. Mr Ó Broin argued that this meant that people who did not need a Help to Buy grant to buy a home were still receiving grants. He explained: ‘When you listen to the Government, they often say Help to Buy is to assist people to get a deposit. The assumption is they don't have a deposit. However, you can get Help to Buy even if you do have a deposit. How you work that out is the applicant has to give their loan-to-value ratio. They have to show how much of a loan they have to buy the property. They only have to have a loan-to-value ratio of 70 per cent....That means they have 30 per cent themselves, or 20 per cent or 10 per cent (of the purchase price to use as a deposit)’",

Minister for Finance Michael McGrath and Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe got Cabinet agreement to keep permanent tax and spending changes within tight enough limits – and to establish the two funds. This was the prudence play. But the political quid pro quo was a bidding up of the once-off measures to benefit households, including energy credits of €450, double weeks for child benefit and welfare and tax relief for mortgage holders. Along with cash required to house Ukrainian refugees, the forecast for the budget surplus next year has fallen from more than €16 billion earlier this year to €8.4 billion now. How quickly these numbers can change. The cumulative surpluses out to 2026, estimated earlier this year at €65 billion are now estimated at €46 billion…For now, the Government is trying to ‘have it all’, both saving and spending.

At the time, RRI founder Jim Connolly suggested Ms Wynne should make a donation to charity, which she said she would be willing to do. Speaking to Shane Ross for his book Mary Lou McDonald – A Republic Riddle, Ms Wynne revealed the party lent her money for unpaid rent. “Mary Lou had phoned me three months after the election and said Sinn Féin would lend me the €12,126 debt which I owed elsewhere.

His company Garuda had to pay €1.2 million after a Revenue audit. He also paid almost €200,000 to settle his personal taxes. (irishtimes, 21/4/2009)",

It also found that one of Lowry's interventions, which cut the selection process to the advantage of Esat, was ‘disgraceful’ and ‘insidious’, and that he had misled the Government, his party leader John Bruton and his own civil servants to influence the selection process in Esat's favour.

The report said that the matter was ‘profoundly corrupt to a degree that was nothing short of breathtaking’. The report also summarised the cumulative payments made to Lowry, and says ‘In aggregating the known payments from Denis O'Brien to Michael Lowry, it is apposite to note that, between the granting of the second GSM licence to Esat Digifone in May 1996, and the transmission of £420,000 sterling to complete the purchase of the latter of Lowry's English properties in December 1999, O'Brien had made or facilitated payments to Lowry of £147,000 sterling, £300,000 sterling and a benefit equivalent to a payment in the form of O'Brien's support for a loan of £420,000 sterling.

Lowry's defamation lawsuit was thrown out in the Circuit court, and again on appeal to the High Court. High Court Justice Nicholas Kearns noted that Lowry ‘did not dispute that he engaged in tax fraud’,and ordered Lowry to pay Smyth's legal costs.(irishindependent, 11/2/2012)",

The note read ‘Taoiseach, would you please consider re-appointing Valerie O'Reilly to the board of the NTA.

Following a motion by fellow Fianna Fáil councillor Leonard Enright, Niall Collins voted at a local area committee meeting in favour of selling the land. The sale to O'Connor was formally approved in 2008 at a meeting of Limerick County Council, for which the minutes included “The disposal of this site was agreed by the members of the Bruff Electoral Area at the meeting held in January 2007”, in which Collins had participated; Collins had been elected TD in May 2007 while the sales process was proceeding. Under the Local Government Act, 2001, a county or city councillor is prohibited from voting when “where he or she has actual knowledge that he or she or a connected person has a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in, or which is material to, the matter”. In December 2007, Eimar O'Connor sought planning permission to build a medical centre and offices on the land, which she had yet to purchase. This permission was given despite objections from local residents, who said in a letter “local school children in the nearby primary school regularly use this green space”. O'Connor became owner of the land in January 2009. Trees and hedging were cut down, and the site left vacant for the following decade. In April 2020, an email was sent to the County Council looking to discuss selling social housing to the Council. Further to this, a planning consultant had claimed that Collins was the owner of the land, a claim Collins denied. (theditch, 19/4/23)",
