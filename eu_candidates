                "quote_one": "In 2022, he was criticised by Irish LGBTQ+ groups for comments described as insulting, when he stated ‘You cannot force me to believe that this lifestyle is right.

Maybe that's natural, but Islam, it strictly forbids from engaging in physical sexual activity with the same gender. Simple as that.’ (gaycommunitynew, 19/8/2022)",
