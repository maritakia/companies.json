We have huge opportunity here, not just for farmers, but right across the globe in terms of food security…With that in mind, this gives us huge opportunities in the areas of drought resistance, a reduction on inputs like fertilisers and pesticides. This is an opportunity to ensure that we can enhance biodiversity, and increase food security, and allow farmers to embrace technologies that are proven for centuries in terms of selective breeding.’  (eu parliament, 22/2/2024)",

Also, there must be an unconditional release of all hostages.And, thirdly, a ceasefire must be established immediately, so that peace can be brought about here and get a political solution, a two-state solution.

And for that reason we shouldn’t be putting limits on what they can do, particularly when they have to trade, which means the animals have to leave the farm. So putting time limits, arbitrary time limits, especially for countries like Portugal and Ireland, makes absolutely no sense. By all means transport them to the highest possible standards, but do not limit the opportunity to trade, because freedom of movement is an essential pillar of the European Union.Having said that, there are a lot of abuses in industrial units, particularly in caged birds, etc., and I do agree we need to move quickly to end the cage age.
