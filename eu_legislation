    "good_subtitle_one": "General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)",

    "bad_subtitle_one": "Austerity Measures and Economic Governance",

Legislation like the GDPR and the European Green Deal has generally had positive effects, while austerity measures and the Dublin Regulation have faced significant criticism. Support and opposition to these legislations often align with the core values of the political groups in the European Parliament, reflecting their priorities and ideologies."
