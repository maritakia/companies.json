He said 1,800 properties pledged by members of the public have housed 5,848 Ukrainians.” (Irish Independent 23 Jan 24) First Time Buyers Scheme - Some 3,200 first-time buyers have availed of the Government’s First Home Scheme since it was launched in July 2022, according to the latest update. The majority of approvals (77 per cent) were for buyers in Dublin, Cork, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow while the average purchase price of homes bought using the scheme in 2023 was €380,000, with the average State support put at €67,000 (18 per cent of the average purchase price). Some of the biggest property developers in the country live in Mr O’Brien’s Dublin Fingal constituency, and some of them gave donations to the-then young first-time Teachta Dála(1997). Other donations came from prominent local businesspeople.() Housing minister Darragh O’Brien has said he doesn’t approve of so-called cuckoo funds buying homes in bulk but banning investment coming into the country would be a “pretty radical move”.(IrishIndependent, 4/5/21) An analysis of Mr O'Brien's donations for 2007 and 2008 shows that €13,790 (33.5%) came from those in property and construction.However, almost 70% (€9,585) of Mr O'Brien's donations from construction and property interests came the year after he was elected, in 2008.

He served as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs from July 2020 to December 2022. Originally from Cabinteely, Brophy studied business at Rathmines College of Commerce. As Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid and Diaspora, Colm Brophy TD, launched the ‘Back for Business’ programme and a call for applicants for this free initiative to help returned emigrants start and develop businesses in Ireland. In its fifth year, the Back for Business developmental programme is funded from the government’s Emigrant Support Programme, and was established to foster and support entrepreneurial activity among emigrants returning to live in Ireland. He lodged a planning objection against plans for a major housing development on a site once owned by former Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave. Dublin South West TD Colm Brophy issued a letter to his constituents telling them he was “fully opposed” to the proposal to build 590 apartments. In the letter, Mr Brophy said he received calls and emails from local residents expressing “concern and horror” about the development which is situated beside the M50 exit in Knocklyon. “We wish to make clear, while we support housing and the need for housing to be provided to meet the current housing crisis which our country faces, we will never support bad planning or over-development as a solution, he said. “The site should be developed as a housing site, but the housing on it should take into account of the existing character of the residential area which it is adjacent to and must also take account of the congestion issues which are currently at breaking point on local roads in the areas,” “In 2022 Brophy as Minister for Overseas Development Aid and Diaspora, called for urgent international action to avert a humanitarian catastrophe in the Horn of Africa, where up to 30 million people are facing acute hunger following four consecutive failed rainy seasons. With regions of Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya on the verge of famine, Minister Brophy has called on the international community to urgently prioritise a humanitarian response to save lives.”(Irishaid.ie, 14/6/22) Minister Brophy stated, “The Horn of Africa is facing a humanitarian catastrophe. We are seeing an alarming rise in malnutrition and mortality levels, particularly in Somalia. Four consecutive rainy seasons have failed, meaning crops have not grown and animals are dying in huge numbers. That has left millions of people with no source of food or income.”",

Thousands of homeowners and tenants around the country are impacted by defective properties with many people living in crumbling homes on the verge of collapse. The Bill will provide homeowners with legal redress where construction work is not properly completed and where materials were not fit for purpose. In a September 2023 interview with TheJournal.ie, Duffy likened a proposed reintroduction of an eviction ban (with exemptions for landlords where the property was needed for “a relative“) to communism, stating “Well then it turns into a communist state, that’s what you are talking about.

Paul has a long record of campaigning for socialist change and standing with our community when we fought austerity from the last two governments. Electing socialist fighters like Paul amplifies our demands, giving us a better shot at defeating the government and winning real change. Paul Murphy's victory in the Dublin South West by-election at the expense of Sinn Féin forced Gerry Adams’ party to change its stance on water charges. That, in turn, forced Fianna Fáil into a massive U-turn ahead of the 2016 election, which, in turn, forced the hand of Enda Kenny in his bid to hold on to office Alongside 27 other activists, he was charged with the False Imprisonment of Joan Burton at a water charges protest in 2014. The #JobstownNotGuilty campaign was victorious in the courts with the first 7 defendants being found not guilty, the attack on the right to protest being defeated and the trumped up charges against all the other activists being dismissed. As well as building the boycott against water charges, he has organised for action on the housing crisis including assisting local residents in a battle with a vulture fund which was attempting to evict them. He campaigned for a Yes vote in the Marriage Equality referendum and in the historic referendum for the Repeal of the 8th Amendment. While a member of the EU Parliment he was a lead campaigner against TTIP (the new EU-US Free Trade Agreement) and the Austerity Treaty.

                  "description":"Leo Eric Varadkar is an Irish politician who has served as Taoiseach since December 2022, and previously from 2017 to 2020. He served as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment from June 2020 to December 2022. He was elected by Dáil Éireann to the role for the second time in December 2022 on the fifth count, having previously served in the role from 2017 to 2020. Leo studied medicine at Trinity College Dublin. He spent several years as a non-consultant hospital doctor, eventually qualifying as a general practitioner in 2010. Minister for Transport, Tourism, and Sport (2011–2014). Minister for Health (2014–2016). Minister for Social Protection (2016–2017). He was appointed Taoiseach in 2017 at 38 years of age becoming the youngest person to hold the office. One of Varadkar's first acts as Taoiseach was to announce a referendum on abortion for 2018. He said that the government would also lay out a road map for achieving a low carbon economy. Varadkar stated he will refuse to ratify the EU–Mercosur free trade agreement unless Brazil commits to protecting the environment. The fear is that the deal could lead to more deforestation of the Amazon rainforest as it expands market access to Brazilian beef. Varadkar is a proponent of tax cuts and welfare reform, and supports investment in Ireland by multinational corporations such as Apple Inc, alongside keeping Ireland's corporate tax rate low. During his time as Minister for Social Protection in 2016 and 2017, Varadkar launched the “Welfare Cheats Cheat Us All” campaign, aimed at those committing welfare fraud. Varadkar is a supporter of CETA, a proposed free trade agreement between Canada and the European Union. However, Varadkar has faced opposition to many aspects of the agreement, not just from opposition parties, but also members of his own government coalition, especially members of the Green party who object in particular to a proposed “investment court” system. Critics of the agreement fear the investment court could be used to strike down environmentalist laws. In October 2023, he condemned the attack on Israel by Hamas, saying, “The Irish government condemns it unreservedly, there can be no excuse for targeting women, children, taking children and women, civilians as hostage”. Varadkar later criticised Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip and what he called the “collective punishment” of people in Gaza. In 2022 Varadkar stated he was in support of the transgender community, and credited a gender recognition legislation brought into law during the Fine Gael/Labour government of 2011 to 2016 as a “huge step forward” in Ireland in terms of trans issues. In 2010 Varadkar stated that he opposed abortion, that he was not in favour of introducing new legislation on abortion, and that he opposed abortion in cases of rape because he felt it would lead to “abortion on demand”. However, by 2014, Varadkar had changed his position and began arguing in the Dáil in favour of abortion up to 12 weeks, and more if the mother's life was in danger. In 2010, Varadkar was an advocate of a scheme in which immigrants to Ireland would be paid to return to their country of origin. Varadkar suggested that at the time of the Nice Treaty referendums in Ireland in the early 2000's, the public were told there would not be large-scale immigration to Ireland in the aftermath, but this was not the case, before further suggesting that Ireland had not been suitably prepared for the amount of immigration it experienced during the Celtic Tiger period. In defence of vulture funds, “A LOT of apartment buildings in Dublin would not have been built without investment funds that tend to run them better than individual landlords”, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said. Mr Varadkar defended the role of investment funds at the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting where there was sustained criticism of the Government’s handling of the housing crisis on Wednesday.(IrishIndependent, 24/1/24) Leo Varadkar submitted a further two false statutory donation statement declarations to SIPO, it can be revealed. The latest revelations are separate from the 2022 donation he failed to declare – and the other two false declarations this failure resulted in – as reported by The Ditch on Friday. It took an ultimatum from SIPO a few months ago for the Fine Gael party leader to admit he also failed to declare three 2018 donations worth more than €2,500, according to documents obtained by The Ditch. Knowingly making a false statutory declaration is a criminal offence.(theditch.ie, 1/1/24)",

                  "description":"Richard Boyd Barrett is an Irish People Before Profit–Solidarity politician who has been a Teachta Dála for the Dún Laoghaire constituency since the 2011 general election. Boyd Barrett is a former member of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council. He holds a master's degree in English literature from University College Dublin. Boyd Barrett stood in the Dún Laoghaire constituency at the 2002 general election for the Socialist Workers Party and at the 2007 general election for the People Before Profit. This switch of identification was intended to increase his support from non-socialist voters. In the run-up to the election in 2007 he participated in high-profile campaigns against high-rise development, bin and water charges and privatisation of hospitals. As a TD, Boyd Barrett, supported protests against cuts to Dublin Bus services, saying that “Some of the older and disabled people are literally prisoners in their homes now as a result of the cut or discontinuation of the service they previously relied on“ He drafted the text of the first Private Members” motion which suggests there is an “overwhelming democratic case” for putting the EU-IMF bank bailout to a referendum of the Irish people. Marie O'Halloran in The Irish Times described his “consistently passionate outrage and opposition to the Government's handling of the financial and banking crisis.“ Boyd Barrett spoke at the Dublin location of the 15 October 2011 global protests, inspired by the Spanish “Indignants” and the Occupy Wall Street movements. The same month he said Enda Kenny's government was engaging in “spin and disingenuity” to cover up its austerity policies, decrying the closure of hospital emergency departments around the country for “health and safety” reasons. On 2 November 2011, Boyd Barrett led the United Left Alliance TDs out of the Dáil, in protest against the government's decision not to hold a debate on the payment of more than €700 million to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders.In October 2012, he confirmed that he had claimed €12,000 in 2011 expenses for travelling to the Dáil from his home in Glenageary, in his Dún Laoghaire constituency – a distance of 12 km. Richard Boyd Barrett has campaigned against Ireland's bank-bail outs and the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), organised protests, and supported initiatives such as The Right to Work Campaign. He also proposed direct investment in public enterprise and strategic industry to create jobs in areas such as renewable energy, food production, generic medicines and IT development.[41] Boyd Barrett has organised a campaign to oppose the sale of St Michael's Hospital to private developers, led campaigns to protect public amenities in Dún Laoghaire, including the Save Our Seafront campaign against a high rise development on the site of the Dún Laoghaire baths, and he has also campaigned to prevent the acquisition of Dún Laoghaire harbour by private companies. Boyd Barrett helped to organise mass protests against the war in Iraq in 2003. He addressed the Dublin leg of the 20 March 2003 International Day of Action. He said that it was “almost certain” that any war would lead to between 50,000 and 100,000 deaths. He said “the complicity of the Irish Government in this murderous war through providing facilities for the US military at Shannon airport” was “an absolute disgrace” and urged people to protest in their thousands “to show this carnage is not being mounted in our names”. In 2009, he supported the pro-democracy protests in Iran. In April 2009, Boyd Barrett addressed the Al-Aqsa Festival fundraising event held at the RDS Concert Hall in Dublin. He said that Israel is “a state built on violence, oppression and apartheid” and “has no right to exist as long as it denies rights to Palestinians”. After the outbreak of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war Boyd Barrett addressed a pro-Palestine rally and compared the situation to the then ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, suggesting that there was a double standard in how the conflicts were perceived in the West. During a session of the Dáil, Boyd Barrett accused Israel of committing ethnic cleansing and taking part in war crimes, and condemned Western governments for failing to hold the Israeli government accountable.",

In December 2020, he was appointed by An Taoiseach as Fianna Fáil Spokesperson on Dublin and in January 2023  he was appointed Fianna Fáil Chief Whip and Deputy Government Whip. He previously served on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, where he was elected to represent the Dún Laoghaire until 2019. He served as Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in 2016-2017. In 2012, Councillors Cormac Devlin and Barry Ward's use of a Local Government Education and Training Fund was reviewed on foot of a complaint from Shane Hogan, a public servant and Labour Party member. Hogan claimed their use of the fund was a breach of Section 168 of the Local Government Act, 2001. The report found neither councillor had breached legislation, noting it was the responsibility of council administrators to ensure payments for training and education went through proper procedure. The report recommended Devlin repay €910 of the fees, which was since repaid. Mr. Hogan branded the report a “whitewash” and subsequently appealed the decision to SIPO. SIPO accepted the recommendations of the report",

Previously, she worked in social care in Kildare and is a mother of four. As a passionate community activist, she set up Maynooth Community First Responders two years ago and continues to work with this and other community organisations. Immediately following her election as a TD in 2020, a number of controversies arose from Cronin's past. It emerged that in 2019, Cronin tweeted that “sinister” Mossad interference in the 2019 United Kingdom General Election was responsible for the defeat of Jeremy Corbyn. Cronin added that Corbyn was a “principled man” victimized by “lies, deceit, fake news, and the sinister activities of the Mossad Service Service”, and that the alleged Mossad actions were “blatant as f***.” After being criticized by the Israeli embassy in Ireland for a “history of paranoid, hate-driven conspiracy theories,” Cronin backtracked, calling her comments “throwaway remarks.” Sinn Féin issued a statement stating that Cronin's remarks “do not represent the views of Sinn Fein.” it was also after her 2020 election that it came to light that Cronin and her husband Donal built a €1,000,000 home in Kildare in 2002 knowing that they did not have full planning permission to do so. When Cronin  and her partner were subsequently caught by Kildare County Council, they lobbied then Minister for Finance Charlie McCreevy to personally intervene, which he did do. Cronin issued a statement in which she declared. “In relation to my former home, there was an issue in respect of planning and this matter was settled in court, with the consent of Kildare County Council”. She recently stated that “The Government must vote to support Sinn Féin’s plan to stop vulture funds from bulk-purchasing homes from under the feet of struggling home buyers.”",

He has been a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Kildare South constituency since 2011. He previously served as the Chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party from 2016 to 2020. New changes to mortgage lending rules will help both first time buyers trying to get on the property ladder, and second time buyers looking for a fresh start, according to Kildare South Fine Gael TD and Minister of State Martin Heydon. Minister Heydon said, “The decision by the Central Bank to relax lending rules for first time buyers will be welcomed by many young individuals and couples across Kildare who are trying to get their foot on the property ladder. The ability to be able to borrow  four times your income brings us more in line with other European countries and will be the difference between some people being able to purchase their own home or not.” Minister Heydon had stated: “Today (13/7/23) we are announcing a €150 million fund to breathe new life into towns and cities across Ireland. This initiative builds on the actions Fine Gael have taken already. Focusing on dereliction and vacancy makes sense. It has a unique ability to rejuvenate communities in our villages, towns and cities in Kildare and across Ireland. And with this fund, we now have a comprehensive set of measures in place to make sure that everyone – individual buyers, developers and local authorities – have a really good incentive to bring disused properties back into use.”",

Ryan's letter stated “There is a concern that growing levels of homelessness and pending evictions in the areas where the modular units are being proposed could generate conflict...If this process is not managed right and the views of locally based representatives are not listened to, the potential for significant conflict with host communities is significant, which in turn could be exploited by small far-right elements”",

Ó Fearghaíl comes from a farming background, and previously worked for Dublin Corporation. He was elected as a member of Kildare County Council in 1985.

In July 2012, he was appointed as Spokesperson on Constitutional Reform, Arts and Culture, and Defence, while retaining the post of party whip. Ó Fearghaíl sent Éamon Ó Cuív a letter gagging him during the European Fiscal Compact referendum campaign, after Ó Cuív expressed his own opinion of the Compact against the party's wishes. In his role as Ceann Comhairle, Ó Fearghaíl has been a vocal supporter of Chinese Government policy and increasing ties between Ireland and China. In 2018, he warned Teachtaí Dála and Senators that contact with Taiwan would  “offend the Chinese government”, and could damage Ireland’s business and diplomatic relationship with China. Accusations of lobbying the Irish Government and political parties on behalf of the Chinese government were leveled by members of the Oireachtas in November 2020. Ó Fearghaíl has also praised China's human rights record and economic policies.",

He previously served as Minister of State for European Affairs from July 2020 to December 2022. In 2007, following his inaugural election to Dáil Éireann, then Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil Bertie Ahern appointed Byrne as the Government Convenor of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection and as a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committees on Justice and Defence, European Affairs and Finance, respectively. Byrne was selected as a Fianna Fáil parliamentary party delegate to the National Forum on Europe. Following the initial unsuccessful referendum to ratify the Lisbon Treaty, Byrne was appointed to an Oireachtas sub-committee tasked with reviewing the causes of the Lisbon Treaty's rejection by the Irish electorate in June 2008. The Treaty was subsequently adopted following a second plebiscite in October 2009. While serving his first Dáil term, the issue of young couple mortgage arrears in Meath East was one of Byrne's primary focuses as he co-authored a bipartisan report which instituted revised code of conduct regulations for mortgage lenders operating in Ireland. As opposition spokesperson for Education and Skills, Byrne opposed so-called “baptism barrier” which was instituted in oversubscribed Irish Catholic primary schools. The practice, in line with Catholic primary schools admissions policies at the time, involved the lawful discrimination of student registration on the basis of religion. Following a bipartisan initiative to remove the obstacle, led by Byrne and then Minister for Education and Skills Richard Bruton, The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was enacted by the Oireachtas, which prohibits selective enrolment predicated on religious factors. In May 2020, speaking as opposition spokesperson for Education and Skills, prior to his appointment as Minister of State for European Affairs, Byrne called on the Government, and Minister for Education Joe McHugh TD, to cancel the 2020 Leaving Certificate and implement “fair alternatives” to alleviate undue student stress and anxiety following months of national uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The call received widespread support and led to the adoption of a predicted grading system in place of the traditional Leaving Certificate for 2020. In December 2022, he was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media with special responsibility for Sport and Physical Education following the appointment of Leo Varadkar as Taoiseach.",

Deputy McEntee also contributed amendments to the Road Traffic Act 2014, to support younger drivers and promote road safety. She also secured funding for the Slane bypass, as well as increased funding for schools and local community sports projects. In addition, McEntee campaigned for improvements to mobile broadband coverage in Meath, and was a vocal supporter of the local agricultural industry. She campaigned for a yes vote in the 2015 referendum concerning the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland, and voted in favour of the proposed abolition of Seanad Éireann, the upper house of the Irish parliament Following a random audit of 22 members of the Oireachtas in 2014, she was one of five politicians required to repay expenses they had claimed that had been declared ineligible.

O'Rourke was previously a policy advisor to Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin TD. He was the Sinn Féin candidate at the 2013 Meath East by-election, which was won by Fine Gael's Helen McEntee. He was unsuccessful again at the 2016 general election, but at the 2020 general election he topped the poll with 24.37% of the first-preference votes, and was elected on the second count. In 2022, O'Rourke put forward a bill to require all pharmaceutical companies to make their payments to healthcare organisations and professionals public in a register. At the close of 2021, O’Rourke launched his Green Hydrogen Strategy Bill 2022 seeking to “ensure the State is prepared to realise the full potential of green hydrogen through the preparation of a national hydrogen strategy”. Initiated in February 2022 and currently at Dáil Second Stage, the Private Members’ Bill would, if enacted, oblige the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to draft and publish a hydrogen strategy within six months. “As in all of these cases, we would rather that the Government lifted it, ran with it, and delivered it itself. It would be the most efficient way to get it done,” O’Rourke remarks. Defining what a national hydrogen strategy for Ireland would look like, the Sinn Féin spokesperson alludes to the European Commission’s strategy which was published in July 2020 and the Scottish experience. “In the context of failing to provide affordable, achievable alternatives for people, the principle of the polluter pays and carbon pricing itself is not something that we are opposed to.”",

Speaking in 2023, Tóibín commentated on his departure from Fianna Fáil by saying “I felt that Fianna Fáil had good people within them, but a lot of the people in Fianna Fáil were career ambitious for themselves and the ideology and the objectives were secondary or weren’t as important” Tóibín was suspended from the Sinn Féin parliamentary party for six months in July 2013, when he defied the party whip by voting against the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013.

                  "description":"Verona Murphy is an Irish Independent politician who has been a Teachta Dála for the Wexford constituency since the 2020 general election. Murphy is President of the Irish Road Haulage Association. She was selected as the Fine Gael candidate for the November 2019 Wexford by-election, which was called after the election of Mick Wallace to the European Parliament. During the by-election campaign, Murphy made remarks supporting Noel Grealish's attempts to block a direct provision centre being created in Oughterard, County Galway, and suggested that immigrants coming to Ireland were being “infiltrated by ISIS” and would need to be “deprogrammed”.  She claimed that immigrants as young as “three or four years old” were a danger because of ISIS brainwashing and that ISIS is a “big part” of the migrant population in Ireland. These remarks were criticised by the Irish Refugee Council and by members of opposition parties in the Dáil. Murphy subsequently apologised for her remarks and issued a statement, stating “This was a very poor choice of words and I am very sorry to anyone who was offended by them.” In the 2020 general election, Murphy was elected as an Independent TD in the Wexford constituency. In November 2021 Murphy was accused of spreading anti-vax information in the Dáil by health minister Stephen Donnelly after Murphy stated studies had shown “that a vaccinated person is every bit as likely to transmit this virus as a non-vaccinated person”. Despite her assertions, Murphy insisted she was not “Anti-Vax” and had been vaccinated herself, but believed the choice to take vaccinations was up to the individual.",

Sinn Féin’s Deputy Johnny Mythen has urged all TDs to back his party’s Dáil motion calling on the Government to revoke the concrete block levy plans. Speaking about the issue, Deputy Mythen, said his party was bringing this weeks motion to replace the Government’s concrete block levy plans which he said will add thousands of euros to new builds and increase the price of new homes in Co. Wexford and beyond. “The scheme must be redesigned,” said Deputy Mythen. “In its current form, people living in homes with defects as well as first time buyers will see their house prices go up,” he said.“The Society of Chartered Surveyors has warned that this levy could see an additional €4,000 added to the price of a house,” he added. Deputy Mythen said it’s “totally unacceptable” that present-day homeowners and buyers should be expected to foot the bill for the pyrite and a mica concrete blocks scandal.",

The government has decided that student loans will not form part of the future funding model. Instead, the government is committing to a multi-funded model of additional Exchequer investment and employer contributions through the National Training Fund.

With a background in ecology, marine science and environmental law, Jennifer believes that we need delivery on climate action now and should use every opportunity at our disposal to effect positive change in this area. Before entering politics, Jennifer spent ten years in Australia as a senior policy analyst alongside government Ministers, developing environmental law, water management and energy policy. She also spent several years working with the Marine Institute as a scientist. In September 2021, Whitmore tabled a Just Transition Bill in the Dáil; the Bill was deliberately almost identical to one the Green Party had tabled in 2017 while in opposition but had been voted down. At the time, Green leader Eamon Ryan called their proposed bill a “critical piece of the architecture” of any policy on climate action. One amendment Whitmore did make however was to define the term “Just Transition”, as the previous version of the bill did not. Whitmore said the bill would define “just transition“ as a green transition that ensures the economic and social consequences of the climate emergency are managed to maximise “opportunities of decent work for all, reduce inequalities, promote social justice, and support industries, workers and communities negatively affected”",

Prior to being elected as a TD, Crowe was a primary school teacher in Parteen National School. Crowe was first elected to Clare County Council in 2004 at 21 years of age, making him the youngest councillor in Ireland. In 2019, as the Mayor of County Clare, he gained attention as the first politician to decide to boycott the government's commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary. He was a member of Clare County Council for the Shannon local electoral area from 2004 to 2020. In March 2023, political news website The Ditch reported that Crowe had not disclosed his ownership of two homes on a planning application to Clare County Council for permission to build a house.  In addition, the same article reported Crowe had falsely claimed to have lived in his parents' house until 2012, when he had in fact bought and moved into a property in 2007. When questioned by RTÉ, Crowe rejected the allegation from The Ditch that he owned two homes and defended his use of the Irish form of his name on the planning application form. Further investigations by The Ditch revealed that Crowe had not declared EU payments in respect of farmland that he owns in County Clare, thereby breaching the rules for declaring sources of income on Dáil ethics returns.",

Elected as a Sinn Féin member, she became an independent in February 2022. She studied psychology at Trinity College Dublin. She is a former member of the Reserve Defence Forces, having been involved for three years. She has worked as a home help provider for young adults with disabilities, a literacy tutor, and for the   crime victims helpline Wynne ran for the position of councillor in Clare County Council during the May 2019 local elections. In 2020, she was chosen by Sinn Féin local branches in Clare to stand for Sinn Féin in the 2020 general election. In April 2020, Wynne was criticised for her conduct on social media by some of her constituents after she referred to Clare TD Pat Breen and former Clare TD (now Senator) Timmy Dooley as “Prat Breen” and “Timmy Do Nothing”. She was also accused of belittling constituents who asked questions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. A spokesperson representing Sinn Féin in County Clare referred to her behaviour as “A prime example why the party's social media guidelines should be followed at all times on social media platforms.” Following the criticisms, Wynne issued a formal apology, stating “I understand that a number of remarks I made on Facebook recently have caused offence. I want to apologise for this and to those involved”. In February 2022, Wynne resigned from Sinn Féin. As part of a press release, Wynne stated “I was a proud Sinn Féin TD and took my membership with the party very seriously, I believed that they were the party for United Irelanders and were the future for this island. I now have experience that I can no longer ignore” and went on to suggest that the party did “not take kindly to autonomy and those who do not follow their plans”. Wynne resolved to continue her work as TD as an Independent Sinn Féin provided a commercial loan to a TD to repay her rent debts. Former Sinn Féin TD Violet-Anne Wynne received €12,000 from the party after it emerged she left a housing charity out of pocket. Rural Resettlement Ireland (RRI) took a case against Ms Wynne over the failure to pay rent but the housing charity no longer existed when details of the TD’s debt emerged after her election to the Dáil in February 2020. At the time, RRI founder Jim Connolly suggested Ms Wynne should make a donation to charity, which she said she would be willing to do. Speaking to Shane Ross for his book Mary Lou McDonald – A Republic Riddle, Ms Wynne revealed the party lent her money for unpaid rent. “Mary Lou had phoned me three months after the election and said Sinn Féin would lend me the €12,126 debt which I owed elsewhere. We reached an agreement...” she said. “I've just finished questioning the Land Development Agency in the Housing Committee and I'm running across to the Dáil to speak on the motion on Gaza and why Ireland must support the South African ICJ case. Israel is committing genocide, and we must act now.”(linkedInProfile, 24/1/24)",

Barry was first elected as a member of Cork City Council in June 2004 and re-elected in June 2009 and May 2014 (both times on the first count). On the 1 May 2013 gardai arrested five members of the Campaign Against Home and Water Taxes, including Barry and fellow Cork City Councillor Ted Tynan of the Workers' Party, during a midday  protest inside the St Patrick's Street branch of the Bank of Ireland in the city. People gathered on the street. Cllr Tynan said he felt a need to stand up against austerity. In the 2010s Barry campaigned on a number of issues locally and nationally, notably the Anti-Bin Tax Campaign with the Householders Against Service Charges (HASC) in Cork. In support of local services in the Cork area such as the cutbacks in bus services, and against the building of a private hospital on the public grounds of Cork University Hospital, and social housing. He called for a ban on home repossessions and considered a controversial Gateway employment scheme to be “slave labour”. He called for standing orders to be suspended and proposed a motion condemning the jailing of five activists opposing a proposed tax on water.",

Burke lost his seat at the 2009 European Parliament election Burke was a member of Cork City Council from 1999 to 2007 and served as Lord Mayor of Cork from 2003 to 2004. He was elected to Seanad Éireann in April 2011 and re-elected in 2016. He was the Fine Gael Seanad Spokesperson on Health. Cork North-Central TD Colm Burke, who is also a partner in Colm Burke & Co. Solicitors, by 2006 had initiated legal proceedings on behalf of more than 70 similar clients. He was a Fine Gael councillor at the time. Burke, now a Fine Gael health spokesperson who sits on the Oireachtas Health Committee, refused to comment to The Ditch when asked about a 2014 case in which the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal found he had misled one of these clients. Burke failed to tell a client he couldn’t represent her until she legally wasn’t permitted to take it. The Irish Mail on Sunday last weekend published a story detailing how the state devised a secret plan to force people illegally charged private nursing home fees into accepting payouts smaller than what they were entitled to. “As a result of this strategy”, said the Mail’s story, “compensation was denied to anyone who did not have the resources to fight legal cases.”(ontheditch.com, 1/21/23)  Burke in 2014 was found guilty by a professional legal body for misleading a presumptive client wishing to take a case against the state.",

                  "description":"Michael Moynihan is an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who has been a Teachta Dála for the Cork North-West constituency since the 1997 general election. Moynihan was born in Cork in 1968, but is a native of Kiskeam, County Cork.  A dairy farmer by profession, he first became involved in national politics in 1997, when he was elected at the 1997 general election to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD. Moynihan was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science from 2004 to 2007. He served as chairman of Ógra Fianna Fáil, the youth wing of the party, until 2005. He topped the poll at the 2002 general election and was re-elected at the 2007, 2011, 2016 and 2020 general elections. He has served as the Fianna Fáil Spokesperson on Agriculture and Food from 2011 to 2012, Spokesperson on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources from 2012 to 2016 and Opposition Chief Whip from 2016 to 2020. His opponent Áine Collins, who is running for Fine Gael has stated “Michael Moynihan won his seat 13 years ago with the slogan 'the Forgotten Constituency. Each election since then he has made all kinds of promises: none which have materialised. He faithfully promised a decentralisation office for Kanturk; he promised to promote industry in the region; he promised an extension to Kanturk hospital and a new school in Kanturk,” She also said that Deputy Moynihan promised to renew and develop industries in the region, but instead Duhallow has experienced huge loss of jobs in the region as the beet factory has closed, Keating's bakery closed up, the Duhallow lodge has closed, Molex in Millstreet also shut its doors, as well as many small industries that have failed in the Duhallow region during the boom. She stated that “if Deputy Moynihan could not develop his promises during the boom years when Fianna Fáil were in power, “what use is he going to be as an opposition TD in these difficult times?.” She maintains that the future for the country lies in the development of small and medium-sized industries. “To survive we cannot afford to waste any more time, our young people are leaving in droves or are unemployed,” she said.",

                  "description":"Simon Coveney is an Irish Fine Gael politician who has served as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment since December 2022 and Deputy leader of Fine Gael since 2017. He previously served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2017 to 2022 and Minister for Defence from 2014 to 2016 and again from 2020 to 2022. He has served as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment since December 2022 and Deputy leader of Fine Gael since 2017. He previously served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2017 to 2022 and Minister for Defence from 2014 to 2016 and again from 2020 to 2022. He has served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork South-Central constituency since 1998. He previously served as Tánaiste from 2017 to 2020, Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government from 2016 to 2017 and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine from 2011 to 2016. He also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the South constituency from 2004 to 2007. After the formation of the coalition government in March 2011, Coveney was appointed Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Following a cabinet reshuffle in July 2014, which saw him also take over the position of Minister for Defence. On the formation of a Fine Gael minority government in May 2016, he was appointed Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.[3] In June 2017, after Leo Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny as Taoiseach, Coveney was appointed as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Deputy leader of Fine Gael. He was appointed Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) in November 2017. As part of the new government formed following the 2020 general election, Coveney was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence in the new cabinet. Coveney provoked controversy when, in September 2011, he flew to Algeria, on the government jet at a cost of more than €26,000 to the Irish taxpayer when there were flights available for €16,331.00. While there, Coveney cut a ribbon at the opening of a supermarket in Oran In January 2017 it emerged that a number of Air Corps whistleblowers had attempted to contact Coveney while he was Defence Minister over their concerns about the adverse health impacts of chemicals used to service the force's aircraft. The whistleblowers had complained about being unable to speak to Coveney about the issue, however Coveney claimed he was “not aware of there being any problem with hearing from, or talking to, or understanding the concerns that whistleblowers may have”. Speaking in the Dáil on the revelations, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin described the Government handling of the whistleblowers complaints as “a scandal”. Coveney and Ireland's ambassador to Ukraine Thérèse Healy visited Ukraine on 13 April 2022 where Coveney met his counterparts, Ukraine foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and defence minister Oleksii Reznikov, in Kyiv and visited the site of the Bucha massacre the following day. Coveney travelled via Poland and was the first foreign minister on the UN Security Council to visit Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February. He was also accompanied by a political adviser and a protection team. In July 2021, Coveney found himself embroiled in a political scandal relating to the appointment of former Fine Gael Minister Katherine Zappone as a special envoy to the UN. During a cabinet meeting of the coalition government, Coveney proposed Zappone for the role without having previously discussed the matter with Taoiseach Micheál Martin. Martin expressed concerns about the appointment but ultimately allowed it. Subsequently, it emerged that Coveney had not advertised or offered the role to anyone but Zappone, and that in the run-up to the appointment, Zappone had hosted an event at the Merrion Hotel in breach of COVID-19 regulations for many members of the political establishment, including Tánaiste Leo Varadkar. In response, many opposition parties accused the appointment as being a product of cronyism. As a result of the controversy, Zappone later declined to take up the role. In September, Coveney admitted that he had deleted texts from his phone in relation to the Zappone affair. Coveney gave a number of reasons for deleting the texts, including that he had deleted them for more storage space, and for security reasons as his phone had previously been “hacked”. Coveney's explanations were criticised by many members of the Dáil, including by members of government coalition members Fianna Fáil.",

                  "description":"Micheál Martin is an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who is serving as Tánaiste, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Minister for Defence since December 2022. He served as Taoiseach from 2020 to 2022 and has been Leader of Fianna Fáil since January 2011. He has been a Teachta Dála for Cork South-Central since 1989. He has served as Tánaiste, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Minister for Defence since December 2022. He served as Taoiseach from 2020 to 2022 and has been Leader of Fianna Fáil since January 2011. He has been a Teachta Dála (TD) for Cork South-Central since 1989. He served as Leader of the Opposition from 2011 to 2020 and held various Cabinet offices under Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen. Born in Cork, Martin initially worked as a teacher before entering politics. He was elected to Cork City Council in 1985, and served as Lord Mayor of Cork from 1992 to 1993. In 1989, he was first elected to Dáil Éireann for Cork South-Central, a seat he has represented ever since. After the victory of Fianna Fáil at the 1997 election, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern appointed Martin to the Cabinet as Minister for Education and Science. In 2000, Martin was appointed Minister for Health and Children. In 2004, during his time as Health Minister, Martin was notable for introducing a ban on tobacco smoking in all Irish workplaces, making Ireland the first country in the world to introduce a full workplace smoking ban. In the same year, Martin established the Health Service Executive. He served as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment from 2004 to 2008, before being appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs by Ahern's successor, Brian Cowen. In 2009, Martin became the first Irish foreign minister to travel to Latin America, during which time he also made the first official visit to Cuba by any Irish minister. Martin also visited Khartoum during his time as Foreign Minister, following the kidnapping of Sharon Commins and Hilda Kawuki. In January 2011, Martin resigned as Foreign Minister in protest at Cowen's leadership. Following Cowen's own resignation as Leader of Fianna Fáil, Martin was quickly elected to replace him. Just weeks later, at the 2011 general election, Martin led Fianna Fáil to the worst result in its 85-year history, with a loss of 57 seats and a popular vote of just 17.4%. He nevertheless remained in the leadership, becoming Leader of the Opposition. Martin led his party through the 2020 general election, which led to Fianna Fáil becoming the largest party in the Dáil by just one seat. After lengthy negotiations, he was appointed Taoiseach on 27 June 2020, leading a grand coalition with longtime rival party Fine Gael, marking the first time these two parties had governed together, along with the Green Party.  As Minister for Education and Science,(1997) his tenure was characterised by an increase in spending at all levels of education, while a number of educational initiatives, such as a review of the primary school curriculum and the introduction of special needs assistants, were also initiated. In spite of tough opposition, Martin introduced a ban on tobacco smoking in all Irish workplaces, including pubs and restaurants. On 30 January 2003 he announced his intention to have the ban in place on 1 January 2004. He visited New York in September 2003 to look at how a similar ban worked there, and signed the UN's framework convention on tobacco control at their headquarters. The smoking ban was introduced on 29 March 2004, making Ireland the first country in the world to introduce a blanket ban on smoking in the workplace. On 4 September 2004 Martin was presented with an award for his work on the smoking ban by the European Respiratory Society in Glasgow.  In October 2003, Martin promised to examine cases of symphysiotomy in Irish hospitals which occurred during the 1940s and 1950s, and offered free health care to those affected. In September 2004, he exchanged government positions with Mary Harney, to become Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The following September, the government's economic record on the cost of living came under scrutiny from the RTÉ television programme Rip-Off Republic. This led to Martin abolishing the controversial Groceries Order 1987, a piece of legislation which prohibited the sale of groceries below cost price. As Minister for Foreign Affairs, Martin was critical of the blockade of Gaza, particularly after being denied access to the area in 2009. He wrote to Spain (incoming holder of the presidency of the Council of the EU) to suggest that the EU send a delegation of foreign ministers to the area in 2010. He made his first visit there himself on 25 February 2010, on a one-day humanitarian mission through the Egyptian border.[44] In doing so, Martin became the first Western foreign minister to visit Gaza since Hamas took control in 2007. While in Gaza, the Minister toured hospitals and schools. He was accompanied by United Nations vehicles. “I would appeal to the Israeli government and all concerned to lift this blockade”. Micheál Martin appeals to Israel while in Gaza on 25 February 2010. The following week Martin wrote about his experience in the International Herald Tribune. Martin was Minister for Foreign Affairs during the Gaza flotilla raid and the aftermath of this incident. He told Dáil Éireann that he had requested that the Israeli government allow the MV Rachel Corrie to deliver its cargo of aid to Gaza instead of involving itself in “further bloodshed”. In January 2018, Martin stated that he would support a relaxation of Ireland's abortion stance, citing “cruel inflexibility and unintended consequences”. Specifically, he said “he would vote in favour of repealing the Eighth Amendment and to allow abortion on request until near the end of the first trimester,” leading to some political conflict within Fianna Fáil. 31 of the party's TDs and Senators posed for a photograph showing their opposition to repealing the eighth amendment, with over half of the parliamentary party supporting a No vote. Late on 16 March 2022, Martin tested positive for COVID-19 while he was at an event in Washington, D.C., United States, being held for St Patrick's Day. He has stated “Ireland will be part of the EU’s travel programme which will see the use of vaccine passports to travel between members states once a passenger is fully vaccinated. He said this would be a crucial boost for the aviation and hospitality sector.”(IrishIndependent, 24/1/24)  Martin made an official visit to Ukraine in July 2022 amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This was the first official visit made by a Taoiseach to Ukraine. Martin stated he would provide support for Ukraine joining the European Union and condemned attacks on civilians. In 2012, Martin clashed with Taoiseach Enda Kenny over the issue of same-sex marriage; Martin needled Kenny in the Dáil to declare a firm position on same-sex marriage and urged him to press ahead with a referendum. In 2015, Martin supported a Yes vote in the 2015 referendum which legalised same-sex marriage. In 2019, Martin voiced his support for a similar referendum in Northern Ireland. In 2021, Martin expressed openness to changing laws regarding transgender teenagers and self-identification, stating he believed that “we should consult young trans people to hear their views”. In a 2022 interview with NXF, Martin said he had “no time” for a “toxic” discussion on transgender people, saying “acceptance is key” and “we should fully accept and acknowledge their identity in the first instance”",

                  "description":"Michael McGrath is an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who has served as Minister for Finance since December 2022. He previously served as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform from 2020 to 2022. He has been a Teachta Dála for the Cork South-Central constituency since 2007. He was a member of Passage West Town Council from 1999 to 2007, and a member of Cork County Council for the Carrigaline local electoral area from 2004 to 2007. McGrath was first elected to the Dáil in 2007, and subsequently, he co-opted his brother Séamus to his county council seat. Séamus would, reportedly, become McGrath's closest political confidant. McGrath represented Fianna Fáil in the Oireachtas delegation that met the Bundestag's Budgetary and European Affairs committees, in Berlin in late January 2012. He represented Fianna Fáil in talks on government formation in 2016 and 2020. In June 2020, following the formation of a coalition government between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party, McGrath was appointed as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. McGrath became Minister for Finance on 17 December 2022 as part of a cabinet reshuffle. McGrath opposed the removal of Article 40.3.3 from the Irish constitution, which prevented the Oireachtas from legislating for abortion, during the 2018 Irish referendum. McGrath then voted in favour of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, legislation which provided for the introduction of abortion. The State has spent nearly €500m of taxpayers’ money giving Help to Buy grants to “people who did not need it”, a Sinn Féin TD has suggested. New figures released to the party’s housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin by Finance Minister Michael McGrath found that between 2017 and 2023, the scheme has cost the State nearly €1bn. The Help to Buy scheme is an incentive for first-time buyers which allows them to €30,000 of their own tax back towards the purchase of a newly built home. In 2017, just €69.4m was claimed under Help to Buy. This increased to €73.5m, €101.1m and €120.4m in 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively. The Help to Buy scheme is an incentive for first-time buyers which allows them to €30,000 of their own tax back towards the purchase of a newly built home. Mr Ó Broin argued that this meant that people who did not need a Help to Buy grant to buy a home were still receiving grants. He explained: “When you listen to the Government, they often say Help to Buy is to assist people to get a deposit. The assumption is they don't have a deposit. However, you can get Help to Buy even if you do have a deposit. How you work that out is the applicant has to give their loan-to-value ratio. They have to show how much of a loan they have to buy the property. They only have to have a loan-to-value ratio of 70 per cent.”...“That means they have 30 per cent themselves, or 20 per cent or 10 per cent [of the purchase price to use as a deposit]”.",

                  "description":"Holly Cairns, also known as Holly McKeever Cairns, is an Irish Social Democrats politician who has been Leader of the Social Democrats since March 2023. She has been a Teachta Dála for Cork South-West since the 2020 general election. Born on a farm in West Cork, Cairns is a farmer working in the family business, Brown Envelope Seeds, producing organic seeds. She has a first class honours MSc in Organic Horticulture from University College Cork. Her mother, Madeline McKeever noted as an environmental activist in West Cork, contested the 2004 Skibbereen Town Council election as a Green Party candidate. Cairns first entered politics as an activist interested in LGBT rights, canvassing on behalf of David Norris during the 2011 Irish presidential election. Following a period living abroad in Malta, Cairns returned to Ireland and joined the Together for Yes campaign during the referendum on repealing the 8th amendment, the amendment which forbade abortion in Ireland in almost all circumstances. Cairns experience during this time prompted her to join the Social Democrats in 2018. She was one of the founding members of the West Cork branch of the party. Cairns was elected to Cork County Council for the Bantry–West Cork local electoral area in the 2019 local elections. Cairns ran on a platform opposing the establishment of a plastics factory in Skibbereen. RTP, the company proposing the factory later withdrew their planning application. After the application was withdrawn, Cairns said that “It also highlights the fact that councillors need to look carefully at rezoning and local area plans to make sure they are in line with government policy on climate change. We can't keep flying the green flag and shy away from taking real climate action decisions”. Cairns campaigns for greater transparency in local government. In late 2019, she raised a motion to ensure that representatives should receive documents three days before having to vote on them. The motion was passed by 53 out of 54 councillors. In April 2021 Cairns advocated to the Minister with responsibility for mental health Mary Butler on behalf of a constituent who feared she would die unless she could receive in-patient treatment for her anorexia and bulimia. Cairns said she was “begging” the Minister to personally intervene in the matter. Cairns noted that she had previously discovered through parliamentary questions that no funding was allocated under the National Eating Disorder Plan for the year 2020 and that none of the €1.6 million allocated for 2019 was spent at all. Cairns called on the government to remedy this, while her Social Democrats colleague Gary Gannon tabled a motion to ensure that funds already allocated for treating eating disorders are ring-fenced for that purpose and not siphoned off to other areas. In May 2021 Cairns questioned the Taoiseach Micheál Martin after he publicly encouraged An Taisce to withdraw an appeal against the construction of a €140 million cheese factory in Co Kilkenny. Cairns suggested that the factory would be a means for the Dutch to keep profiting from dairy products while cutting their herd numbers to met environmental standards, using Ireland as a proxy; “I presume you're aware Glanbia is in partnership with a Dutch company. And in the past few years, Holland has reduced its herd by 190,000, while we have increased ours by half a million“. In November 2020, Cairns opposed a parliamentary motion to allocate state funding to the greyhound racing industry. Despite Cairns” lobbying, in 2021 Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue committed €19.2 million in taxpayer money to funding greyhound racing. Cairns announced on 26 February 2023, that she would run for leader of Social Democrats. Nominations were due to close on 1 March, but none of the other TDs within the party chose to run in the election and as result Cairns was announced as the new leader. Cairns took over leadership of the Social Democrats on 1 March 2023. On becoming leader, Cairns reiterated that the Social Democrats have no interest in merging with the Labour party, and that housing and Sláintecare would be red line issues for the Social Democrats in any coalition talks with any party.",

Cork South West Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan recently hosted Billy Kelleher MEP for a series of meetings with key fishing sector representatives in West Cork. “It's no secret that the fishing sector has faced unprecedented challenges over the past couple of years,” said Deputy O'Sullivan. “It's essential that our MEPs have a clear understanding of these issues, and I’m glad Billy - who is no stranger to West Cork or the fishing industry - came to these important discussions.” Stakeholders at the meetings included fishermen and processors, who took the opportunity to express their frustrations and concerns directly to both Deputy O'Sullivan and MEP Kelleher. Among the critical topics discussed were impacts of Brexit, the urgent need for Ireland to increase its quota share across various species, the importance of timely payments for those who participate in decommissioning, and the high level of regulation and policing faced by the Irish fishing sector.“Brexit has had a major impact on Cork’s fishing industry due to quota reductions,” Mr Kelleher said. “Any changes in fishing policy must take into account Brexit and the changing migratory paths of fish species. Fishers want to see a sustainable future for themselves, their families, and the wider community that they work as part of”.(afloat.ie, 5/4/23)",

He stated,  “For many, in Kerry, their local garda station is a comforting call away. It means they are getting a sympathetic ear and someone with local knowledge. However, under the new Computer Aided Dispatch II (CADII) system, calls are now routed to Cork City.“She was directed to the Cork dispatch centre, whereupon the call rang out. She called again and managed to get someone in the Killarney station. However by the time her details were taken those involved had left. This is, plainly, not acceptable. Whilst I understand the need for reform and rationalisation of resources, the dispatch of Gardai in what was an urgent incident did not occur, and an opportunity to intervene was missed.” Deputy Daly said he plans to raise the issue with the Minister for Justice. “If there is a new system resources should be in place to ensure speed of response. Communities in Kerry, and Gardaí themselves will lose faith in this response otherwise.”(IrishIndependent, 25,1,24)",

Her father Denis Foley was a TD for Kerry North for over 18 years. Foley was previously a member of Kerry County Council for the Tralee local electoral area, serving from 1994 until her election to the Dáil in 2020. She also served as a member of Tralee Urban District Council until its abolition in 2014. Foley was appointed Minister for Education in June 2020 following the formation of a new coalition government, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. Her tenure to date has resulted in several gaffes, most prominently involving the COVID-19 impact on education and state examinations.(breakingnews.ie, 1/2/22) In September 2020, Foley announced that two coding errors were identified in the Leaving Certificate calculated grades system. She apologised and announced that around 7,200 students were affected, receiving a higher grade than they should have while some students received a lower grade. It was later confirmed that a third error was identified.  In January 2021, Foley and the government were forced to abandon plans for Leaving Certificate students to attend school for three days a week, and instead students would return to homeschooling until February, after the ASTI directed its members not to return to in-school teaching. Also in January, Foley was forced to abandon plans to reopen special schools for thousands of children with special educational needs following safety concerns among staff unions. In February, Foley announced a new phase of planning for the Leaving Certificate exams, but the ASTI withdrew from discussions with the Department of Education after it said that the plan being developed would not provide a “meaningful Leaving Certificate” for students. In March, she lost her appeals against findings that two home-schooled students were unfairly excluded from the Leaving Certificate calculated grades process.(IrishTimes, 9/3/21)  On 17 December 2022, she was re-appointed to the same position following Leo Varadkar's appointment as Taoiseach.",

                  "description":"Michael Healy-Rae is an Irish independent politician who has been a Teachta Dála for the Kerry constituency since 2016, and previously from 2011 to 2016 for the Kerry South constituency. He previously served as Chair of the Committee on European Union Affairs from 2016 to 2020. He is the youngest son of Jackie Healy-Rae who served as TD for the Kerry South constituency from 1997 to 2011 as an independent and brother of fellow constituency TD Danny Healy-Rae. He has worked in plant hire and owns a pub in Kilgarvan, businesses associated with the Healy-Rae family. Prior to entering national politics, he was a member of Kerry County Council from 2004 to 2016 for the Killarney local electoral area. His son, Jackie Healy-Rae Jnr, was elected as a councillor for Castleisland LEA at the 2019 Kerry County Council election. In autumn 2007, Michael Healy-Rae took part in a reality television show on RTÉ called Celebrities Go Wild, set in the “unforgiving landscapes” of Connemara, County Galway. He emerged as the winner, having received the largest number of votes from the “viewing public”. In June 2011, news broke of a voting scandal, for which journalist Senan Molony received the award for “Scoop of the Year” at the National Newspapers of Ireland's Journalism Awards. It was revealed that Healy-Rae had received 3,636 votes from a phone in Leinster House, at a cost of €2,600 to the Irish taxpayer, the premium-rate calls being charged a tariff designed to raise money for charity.(irishtimes, 16,5,11 ) On 29 June 2011, Healy-Rae said that while he was not involved in the calls, he would pay the money back.(irishtimes, 29/6,11) Healy-Rae was appointed to the board of the Citizens' Information Board in April 2009. He was asked twice to resign his position from the board because of a conflict of interest between his subsequent membership of the Dáil and his membership of a body advising the Minister for Social Protection. After he refused to resign, the Minister dismissed him in July 2011.(irishtimes, 14/7/11) In May 2020, he was refused planning permission to convert the ground floor of Nancy Myles Pub in the Ballymullen area of Tralee. The plan was for four apartments and had met with strong local opposition. The council's decision was appealed by a number of locals and a conservation organisation. The majority of the decision to refuse was based on the grounds that the proposal would not allow the residents enough natural light or amenity standards.[30] It was the second time the appeals board has overturned a decision by Kerry County Council to grant him a change of use for the pub.(rtenews, 27/5/20) In February 2021 the Register of Members Interests was published, covering 2020, revealing that he remained the largest landlord in the Dáil, with 5 plots of land, 16 properties. A quarter of TDs are landlords or property investors.(IrishExaminer, 17/6/20) He has also listed in the register of TDs interests that he is a postmaster, farmer, plant hire business operator and shop owner. His plant-hire business has worked for the Health Service Executive and he has a contract for providing fuel to Kerry County Council. In May 2020, a complaint was lodged with the clerk of the Dáil over his failure to declare his interest in The Skellig Hotel Experience, a company that ran the Skellig Star Hotel in Cahersiveen. He had a 25% share in the company after investing €25,000 in January 2019, but there was no entry for his shareholding on the Oireachtas Register of Interests. Oireachtas members are required to declare any shareholding over €13,000.[32] When controversy over the leasing of the hotel Michael Healy-Rae said that he was not involved in the leasing of the hotel, but he later accepted the Skellig Hotel Experience held the lease.(IrishExaminer, 18/6/20) The company was sold in December 2019 to Paul Collins who runs direct provision centres. Michael Healy-Rae was adamant that he had no knowledge that it would be converted into a direct provision centre.(IrishExaminer, 23/5/20)",

He previously served as the leader of the Labour Party from April 2020 to March 2022, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Deputy leader of the Labour Party from 2014 to 2016 and a Minister of State from 2011 to 2014. He was a Member of the European Parliament for the South constituency from 2009 to 2011 and a Senator for the Agricultural Panel from 2007 to 2009 Kelly attended University College Cork (UCC), where he completed a BA in English and History in 1995. Two years later he completed a M.Phil in Political History. Kelly continued his education at Boston College, where he achieved a Certificate in Leadership in 1999. He returned to Ireland shortly after this and completed a MBS in eCommerce in 2002. Kelly subsequently worked as an eBusiness Manager with Bord Fáilte and Fáilte Ireland. In Kelly's final year of secondary school, he canvassed for the Labour Party during the 1992 general election. He remained active in left-wing politics in university, establishing the Jim Kemmy Branch of the Labour Party in UCC. He then became involved in a number of by-elections, local election campaigns in Cork and in the wider Munster area. He has stated that he was “politically socialised in Cork”. Kelly became Chair of Labour Youth in 2000, having previously served as co-chair. In 2001 he was a member of the General Council. In 2001 and 2002 he was director of the Tom Johnson Summer School and was also a member of the General Election Planning Committee in the period 2001–2002. In 2007, Kelly was elected to Seanad Éireann on the Agricultural Panel. Later in 2007, Eamon Gilmore, the newly elected leader of the Labour Party, appointed Kelly as Spokesperson on Tourism and was Seanad Spokesperson on Finance and Local Government.  At the 2009 European Parliament election, Kelly was for the South constituency, taking the last seat in a tight battle between him, Sinn Féin's Toireasa Ferris and the Independent Kathy Sinnott. Kelly was a member of the European Parliament's Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. He also served on the Delegation for Relations with the United States. After the formation of a Fine Gael–Labour coalition government, Kelly was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport with responsibility for Public and Commuter Transport.  His involvement in Irish Water was controversial during his tenure as minister. He received death threats on a regular basis during his tenure as minister. As minister, Kelly announced a two-year rent freeze to combat the housing crisis. He said that “blockages” had made solving the housing crisis difficult. A law brought in by Kelly was criticised by the Irish Planning Institute (IPI).Councillors opposed to the law said that it was a “power grab”, and claimed it could significantly limit the planning powers of local government.(rtenews, 21/2/16) EU Commissioner Phil Hogan moved to distance himself from the controversies with Irish Water by stressing that Kelly was now in charge of water. Barry Cowen claimed in relation to a policy change that “the issue with the policy is that everytime Alan Kelly picks up a phone to a journalist, his policy for Irish Water changes and it’s become absolutely farcical.”(thejournal.ie, 19/10/20) In 2015, the Sunday Business Post claimed that Kelly “ignored expert advice by giving €1.5 million in grants to towns in his new constituency”, stating that was responsible for the active travel towns scheme, which provides funding for walking and cycling routes to get people to switch from their cars. He gave €1 million to Clonmel and more than €500,000 to Thurles under the scheme, even though projects from other towns “got significantly higher marks” in assessments.(businesspost, 4/1/22)  In September 2017, Kelly called for the HPV vaccine (vaccine for cervical cancer) to be given to all schoolboys in Ireland. The vaccine's roll-out among girls had recently been subject to controversy over its alleged side effects.(Dáil questions, 1/3/22)  Brendan Howlin stood down as party leader following the 2020 general election. Kelly was nominated in the leadership election by two of the party's six TDs, Seán Sherlock and Duncan Smith. He was also publicly supported by former Labour TDs Jan O'Sullivan and Willie Penrose. Launching his election bid, Kelly said that a complete rebuild of the Labour Party was needed. On 3 April 2020, he was announced as the new leader of the Labour Party, having won 55% of the vote.(rtenews, 3/4/20) He announced his resignation as party leader on 2 March 2022, citing a lack of confidence in his leadership from party colleagues. He announced he would stay on as leader until a replacement was appointed, and would remain as a TD for Tipperary. Following an uncontested election, Ivana Bacik succeeded Kelly on 24 March.(rtenews, 24/3/22)",

He is the Green Party spokesperson for Transport, Energy and Climate Action. On 23 July 2021, President Michael D. Higgins signed the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 into law, setting Ireland on a legally-binding path to net-zero emissions no later than 2050, and to a 51 per cent reduction in emissions by the end of this decade. Of the Climate Bill and subsequent climate action, Leddin said “With societal transformation will come unparalleled economic and employment opportunities – in renewable energy, nature conservation, sustainable transport and in retrofitting our homes and schools and hospitals. Climate action will help rebalance our society as a fairer and healthier one, which treads far more lightly on our land.”(irishtime, 27/9/21) In June 2021, Leddin was accused of conflict of interest after it was revealed that Arup, his former employer of five years, were consulting engineers on the Shannon LNG project.

In December 2022, he was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with special responsibility for Local Government and Planning following the appointment of Leo Varadkar as Taoiseach. “The need for one-off rural housing is very important at the minute, particularly with the announcement of the green agenda,” he said, urging further improvements in public transport to ease this. “We need to relax laws on rural villages to allow people go back and live and work there.”(irishindependent, 25/1/24) In his role as Minister, O’Donnell recent developments such as Ostmen Place, a social housing development consisting of 14 social housing units in Ballytruckle, funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage under the Housing for All programme and St. Joseph’s House Housing Development, on the landmark site on Manor Hill.

His uncle Gerry Collins is a former Minister and MEP, who was a TD for Limerick West from 1967 to 1997. Another uncle, Michael J. Collins, sat for Limerick West in the Dáil from 1997 until he retired in 2007. Collins originally trained as an accountant having worked with Ernst & Young along with being a former lecturer at the Limerick Institute of Technology. Prior to his election to Dáil Éireann, Niall was deputy CEO of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board. Collins was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 2007 general election for Limerick West. He has served in various Fianna Fáil Front Bench roles, as Opposition Spokesperson for Justice and Equality from 2011 to 2016, Opposition Spokesperson for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation from May 2016 to March 2018 and Opposition Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Trade from March 2018 to June 2020. In February 2023, political news website The Ditch published a story claiming that Collins had misled Limerick County Council about his place of residence in a 2001 planning application.The Ditch found publicly available information that showed that Collins's wife, Eimear O'Connor, a GP, requested to buy land from Limerick County Council in 2006. Following a motion by fellow Fianna Fáil councillor Leonard Enright, Niall Collins voted at a local area committee meeting in favour of selling the land. The sale to O'Connor was formally approved in 2008 at a meeting of Limerick County Council, for which the minutes included “The disposal of this site was agreed by the members of the Bruff Electoral Area at the meeting held in January 2007”, in which Collins had participated; Collins had been elected TD in May 2007 while the sales process was proceeding. Under the Local Government Act, 2001, a county or city councillor is prohibited from voting when “where he or she has actual knowledge that he or she or a connected person has a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in, or which is material to, the matter”. In December 2007, Eimar O'Connor sought planning permission to build a medical centre and offices on the land, which she had yet to purchase. This permission was given despite objections from local residents, who said in a letter “local school children in the nearby primary school regularly use this green space”. O'Connor became owner of the land in January 2009. Trees and hedging were cut down, and the site left vacant for the following decade. In April 2020, an email was sent to the County Council looking to discuss selling social housing to the Council. Further to this, a planning consultant had claimed that Collins was the owner of the land, a claim Collins denied.(theditch, 19/4/23)",

Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said at the “very basic level, she should say what officials in Fine Gael asked her to appoint Mr McNulty to the board of Imma”. Although Humphreys said John Nulty was selected “on merit”, she later admitted she regretted the decision. In March 2016, Humphreys approved a decision to demolish the buildings 13–19 on Moore Street as she deemed them to not be of “historical importance”. The buildings were where the leaders of the 1916 Easter rising surrendered.(irishtimes, 9/4/16) On 30 November 2017, she was appointed as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation On 27 June 2020, she was appointed as Minister for Social Protection and Minister for Rural and Community Development by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.

Smith also said that Ireland would now tolerate “the low-level presence of, as yet, unauthorised GMO varieties in imports of animal food“.

Fianna Fáil TD Niamh Smyth has repeatedly failed to declare an interest in a property she twice claimed to own in planning applications.  The Cavan–Monaghan TD previously secured €350,000 in state aid – which was later withdrawn – from a Fianna Fáil minister for the property through an entity that does not appear to have ever existed. Smyth, a former county councillor, has never declared an interest in the property in her annual ethics returns since becoming a TD in 2016.

I am calling on Niamh Smyth, Brendan Smith and Heather Humphreys to stand up for workers, families and aspiring homeowners in Cavan-Monaghan by voting to support Sinn Féin’s motion to end this scandalous practice. The purchase of 46 family homes at Belcamp Manor in Balgriffin in Dublin by an investment fund was yet another blow to struggling first time buyers.Additional figures released to Sinn Féin Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty by the Department of Finance show that since the government’s half-baked measures were introduced, over 1,200 homes have been snapped up by these funds.”(paulinetully.ie/statements/, 22/1/24)",

He is a patron of the People's Movement, which campaigned against the Lisbon Treaty. He previously worked for Donegal County Council, where he managed a water treatment plant and was a shop steward.  Pringle was previously a member of Donegal County Council, having been elected as an independent member in 1999, and then as a Sinn Féin candidate in 2004. He left Sinn Féin in 2007, and retained his seat as an independent in 2009. Pringle was elected as a TD for the Donegal South-West constituency at the 2011 general election, unseating the incumbent Tánaiste Mary Coughlan. He quickly became an ally of Luke “Ming” Flanagan, elected as an independent TD at the same time as Pringle, but for the Roscommon–South Leitrim constituency.  Flanagan and Pringle would go on to support each other on many issues, including reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and opposition to the MERCOSUR deal. Even when Flanagan was elected as an MEP for the Midlands–North-West constituency after spending three years in the Dáil, Flanagan and Pringle continued to work together, and Flanagan visited Donegal to canvass for Pringle ahead of the 2020 general election. On 5 December 2011, Pringle delivered a televised address to the nation, representing the technical group of TDs in Dáil Éireann. He did so in response to Taoiseach Enda Kenny's Address to the nation of the previous evening. Later that month, Pringle called on people for support in a campaign not to pay a new household charge brought in as part of the latest austerity budget, and announced that he would not register for the tax or pay it. Pringle put forward a bill calling on the government to end public spending from fossil fuels, which passed, making Ireland the first country to fully divest public money from fossil fuels.[10] In June 2022, Pringle put forward a bill proposing a referendum on lowering the voting age to 16.",

Grealish first contested an election in 1999, when he was elected to Galway County Council to represent the Oranmore local electoral area, with 1,357 first preferences. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 2002 general election, with 2,735 first preferences, succeeding long-serving TD Bobby Molloy. He was re-elected at the 2007 general election, with 5,806 first preferences. As one of only two Progressive Democrat TDs elected in 2007, he was appointed as Chairman of the Progressive Democrats Parliamentary Party in June 2007. He was Deputy Leader of the Progressive Democrats from 25 May 2007 to 24 March 2009, succeeding Liz O'Donnell in the position. He assumed the leadership of the Progressive Democrats on 24 March 2009, following the decision of then-leader Ciarán Cannon to stand aside and join Fine Gael. Grealish served as interim and final leader of the party until 20 November 2009, at which point the party disbanded. He sits as an Independent TD in Dáil Éireann, and was re-elected as an Independent deputy at the 2011, 2016 and 2020 general elections. He supported the Fianna Fáil-Green Party government in parliamentary votes from 2007 until 24 September 2010, when he announced that he was withdrawing his support for the government due to health cuts. In September 2019, Grealish faced criticism and calls to resign after he made comments about asylum seekers, described by some commentators as racist, which described all African asylum seekers as “spongers”. Grealish courted further criticism on 12 November 2019, when he claimed in the Dáil that immigrants in Ireland were sending vast sums of money out of the country, and singled out Nigerian residents in Ireland, claiming they were sending €3.5 billion in funds back to relatives in Nigeria. Grealish went on to suggest this amount could have been generated by crime.(rtenews, 13/11/19) In August 2020, Grealish became one of the figures of the Oireachtas Golf Society scandal, when members of the Oireachtas Golf Society were accused of breaching the rules set down by the Irish government about gathering during the COVID-19 pandemic. Grealish served as Captain of Oireachtas Golf Society and the event took place under his leadership, with the invitation to the event bearing his personal signature and the signature of President of the Society Donie Cassidy. Following the details of the event becoming known to the public, Galway City Mayor Mike Cubbard and Galway County Council Chairperson James Charity called on Grealish to resign as a TD. In February 2021 the Director of Public Prosecutions announced Grealish would be criminally prosecuted for his role in Golfgate. In May Grealish was issued a summons for a court date of 22 July. The case was adjourned until 28 October. On 3 February 2022, Grealish, Cassidy, and their co-defendants were acquitted of all charges. The Court concluded: “They were all responsible people who would not have gone to a dinner unless they felt comfortable and unless the organisers had not put in place all that was required to make it safe.” Grealish said he was “delighted with the outcome”.(theirishtimes, 17/3/22)",

Following the 2002 general election, he was appointed to the cabinet as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. In 1994, Ó Cuív raised concern amongst some in Fianna Fáil when he suggested the possibility of a prospective conditional return to the Commonwealth of Nations as a gesture to Unionists in Northern Ireland.[8] However, a straw poll of backbench Fianna Fáil TDs in 1998 showed that this had little support.(irishindependent, 30/11/98) In 2007, Ó Cuív again called for Ireland to return to the Commonwealth as a full member state, in light of the restoration of devolution to Northern Ireland and the meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Belfast.(web.archive.org, 12/1/08) In July 2009, Ó Cuív used a government helicopter to open a playground, at the cost of €10,000.(IrishIndependent, 22/7/09) On 23 March 2010, in a cabinet reshuffle, he was appointed as Minister for Social Protection.

He was elected to Galway County Council for the Tuam local electoral area following the local elections held in May 2014. He entered national politics in a by-election caused by the election of Luke “Ming” Flanagan to the European Parliament. He was endorsed by Flanagan. He was a founding member of the Independent Alliance, which was formed in 2015. Fitzmaurice is in favour of cutting turf (peat). Turbary rights have been affected by the Habitats Directive, which has resulted in the protection of some raised bogs in Ireland since the 1990s. As at the end of 2018 protection of some bogs as Special Areas of Conservation remains in force, but Fitzmaurice and other politicians have succeeded in removing protection from some bogs designated as Natural Heritage Areas under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.(connachttribute, 21/12/18) He supports water meters, although he thinks some usage should be free to consumers. Fitzmaurice is a critic of environmental vegetarianism. Defending Irish livestock farmers, he criticised the former President Mary Robinson for advocating reduced meat and dairy consumption so that people have a lower carbon footprint. Along with several other TDs, he later criticised Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for comments about trying to reduce his consumption of meat.(irishexaminer, 15/1/19)",

                  "description":"Thomas Pringle is an Irish independent politician who has been a Teachta Dála for the Donegal constituency since the 2016 general election, and previously from 2011 to 2016 for the Donegal South-West constituency.  He is a patron of the People's Movement, which campaigned against the Lisbon Treaty. He previously worked for Donegal County Council, where he managed a water treatment plant and was a shop steward.  Pringle was previously a member of Donegal County Council, having been elected as an independent member in 1999, and then as a Sinn Féin candidate in 2004. He left Sinn Féin in 2007, and retained his seat as an independent in 2009. Pringle was elected as a TD for the Donegal South-West constituency at the 2011 general election, unseating the incumbent Tánaiste Mary Coughlan. He quickly became an ally of Luke “Ming” Flanagan, elected as an independent TD at the same time as Pringle, but for the Roscommon–South Leitrim constituency.  Flanagan and Pringle would go on to support each other on many issues, including reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and opposition to the MERCOSUR deal. Even when Flanagan was elected as an MEP for the Midlands–North-West constituency after spending three years in the Dáil, Flanagan and Pringle continued to work together, and Flanagan visited Donegal to canvass for Pringle ahead of the 2020 general election. On 5 December 2011, Pringle delivered a televised address to the nation, representing the technical group of TDs in Dáil Éireann. He did so in response to Taoiseach Enda Kenny's Address to the nation of the previous evening. Later that month, Pringle called on people for support in a campaign not to pay a new household charge brought in as part of the latest austerity budget, and announced that he would not register for the tax or pay it. Pringle put forward a bill calling on the government to end public spending from fossil fuels, which passed, making Ireland the first country to fully divest public money from fossil fuels.[10] In June 2022, Pringle put forward a bill proposing a referendum on lowering the voting age to 16.",

He assumed the leadership of the Progressive Democrats on 24 March 2009, following the decision of then-leader Ciarán Cannon to stand aside and join Fine Gael. Grealish served as interim and final leader of the party until 20 November 2009, at which point the party disbanded. He sits as an Independent TD in Dáil Éireann, and was re-elected as an Independent deputy at the 2011, 2016 and 2020 general elections.

In September 2019, Grealish faced criticism and calls to resign after he made comments about asylum seekers, described by some commentators as racist, which described all African asylum seekers as “spongers”. Grealish courted further criticism on 12 November 2019, when he claimed in the Dáil that immigrants in Ireland were sending vast sums of money out of the country, and singled out Nigerian residents in Ireland, claiming they were sending €3.5 billion in funds back to relatives in Nigeria. Grealish went on to suggest this amount could have been generated by crime.(rtenews, 13/11/19) In August 2020, Grealish became one of the figures of the Oireachtas Golf Society scandal, when members of the Oireachtas Golf Society were accused of breaching the rules set down by the Irish government about gathering during the COVID-19 pandemic. Grealish served as Captain of Oireachtas Golf Society and the event took place under his leadership, with the invitation to the event bearing his personal signature and the signature of President of the Society Donie Cassidy. Following the details of the event becoming known to the public, Galway City Mayor Mike Cubbard and Galway County Council Chairperson James Charity called on Grealish to resign as a TD. In February 2021 the Director of Public Prosecutions announced Grealish would be criminally prosecuted for his role in Golfgate. In May Grealish was issued a summons for a court date of 22 July. The case was adjourned until 28 October. On 3 February 2022, Grealish, Cassidy, and their co-defendants were acquitted of all charges. The Court concluded: “They were all responsible people who would not have gone to a dinner unless they felt comfortable and unless the organisers had not put in place all that was required to make it safe.” Grealish said he was “delighted with the outcome”.(theirishtimes, 17/3/22)",

In 1994, Ó Cuív raised concern amongst some in Fianna Fáil when he suggested the possibility of a prospective conditional return to the Commonwealth of Nations as a gesture to Unionists in Northern Ireland.[8] However, a straw poll of backbench Fianna Fáil TDs in 1998 showed that this had little support.(irishindependent, 30/11/98) In 2007, Ó Cuív again called for Ireland to return to the Commonwealth as a full member state, in light of the restoration of devolution to Northern Ireland and the meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Belfast.(web.archive.org, 12/1/08) In July 2009, Ó Cuív used a government helicopter to open a playground, at the cost of €10,000.(IrishIndependent, 22/7/09) On 23 March 2010, in a cabinet reshuffle, he was appointed as Minister for Social Protection. After the resignation of Tony Killeen in January 2011, Ó Cuív was also appointed as Minister for Defence, and he was also appointed Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Ó Cuiv was the Fianna Fáil Spokesperson for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources after Fianna Fáil were ousted from power at the 2011 general election. On 8 August 2011, party leader Micheál Martin, named Ó Cuiv as deputy leader of Fianna Fáil. In 2018, he was one of 25 TDs to vote against the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, which proposed to replace the protection of the life of the unborn inserted by the Eighth Amendment with a provision allowing the termination of pregnancy to be regulated by law. This amendment was approved in a referendum in May 2018 by 66.4%, including 65.9% in his constituency. Ó Cuív was one of 15 TDs to vote against the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill, which became law at the end of 2018.",

He was elected to Galway County Council for the Tuam local electoral area following the local elections held in May 2014. He entered national politics in a by-election caused by the election of Luke “Ming” Flanagan to the European Parliament. He was endorsed by Flanagan. He was a founding member of the Independent Alliance, which was formed in 2015. Fitzmaurice is in favour of cutting turf (peat). Turbary rights have been affected by the Habitats Directive, which has resulted in the protection of some raised bogs in Ireland since the 1990s. As at the end of 2018 protection of some bogs as Special Areas of Conservation remains in force, but Fitzmaurice and other politicians have succeeded in removing protection from some bogs designated as Natural Heritage Areas under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.(connachttribute, 21/12/18) He supports water meters, although he thinks some usage should be free to consumers. Fitzmaurice is a critic of environmental vegetarianism. Defending Irish livestock farmers, he criticised the former President Mary Robinson for advocating reduced meat and dairy consumption so that people have a lower carbon footprint. Along with several other TDs, he later criticised Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for comments about trying to reduce his consumption of meat.(irishexaminer, 15/1/19)",
