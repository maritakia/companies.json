        "description": "Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the two dominant political parties in Ireland, have collectively held power for the vast majority of the country's history since gaining independence. Fianna Fáil has been in government for around 61 years in total since its first government in 1932. Fine Gael has been in government for about 32 years since 1933, following the merger of Cumann na nGaedheal, the National Guard (Blueshirts), and the National Centre Party. Together, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have shaped the political landscape of Ireland for nearly a century, with their policies and leadership defining much of the country's modern history. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, historically rival political parties, formed a coalition government for the first time in June 2020.In their ‘Programme for Government’ they outlined their priorities in a manifesto. Fine Gael describes itself as centre-right and Fine Fail as centre-left, but ideologically they both appear to have similar policies and support similar legislation and can be characterised as globalist parties.",

Despite these stated goals, the government has faced criticism for its handling of the healthcare infrastructure crisis, particularly in relation to the construction of the new National Children’s Hospital.

Since the scheme relies on farmers adhering to specific environmental practices, any delays in verification or approval processes can result in delayed financial support, creating cash flow issues. ACRES promotes specific environmental measures, such as reduced chemical inputs, rewilding, or afforestation, which can limit traditional farming activities.

These legislative efforts reflect their commitment to addressing key social issues and improving the quality of life for all citizens, particularly the most vulnerable in society. The positive impacts of these policies include greater protection for workers, improved gender equality, LGBTQ+ issues, expanded access to affordable housing, and significant strides toward environmental sustainability and healthcare reform.While the Labour Party and the Social Democrats generally align their support with their core policies, there have been instances where their actions or the outcomes of their supported policies have been criticised. These include perceived compromises on their principles, negative economic impacts on vulnerable communities, and policies that did not fully address the needs of their traditional voter base."

This could lead to overcrowded facilities, longer waiting times for public services, and increased competition for housing and jobs, particularly in already under-resourced communities.  In areas with limited infrastructure or where public services are already stretched, the sudden arrival of a large number of immigrants could exacerbate social tensions, increase pressure on housing and healthcare, and create challenges in integrating new arrivals.

We are committed to lowering the tax burden of hard working individuals and families.The OECD has reported that Ireland has the second most progressive tax system among its 36 members. That basically means middle to higher earners pay disproportionately more in income tax than nearly every other developed country. Middle income earners pay the higher rate of tax of 40% at E35,300. This is too early and we are committed to increasing the threshold to E50,000 which will allow middle income earners to keep more of their hard earned money.",
        "pol_two_3": "CRIME: Ireland is in the grip of a violent crime wave that has some communities living in fear. Under the political establishment, drug gangs are terrorising areas of the country and carrying out some of the most barbaric violent crimes the country has ever witnessed. The Irish Freedom Party views this crime wave as a national emergency and will take appropriate action. Many of our Gardaí are ill equipped to deal with this particular type of crime and need to be supported. We believe the army should be deployed to patrol the most sensitive areas to back up our Gardaí and bring reassurance to communities. Much tougher sentencing for drug dealing offences will be a priority.",
        "pol_two_4": "FREEDOM OF SPEECH: Our most fundamental rights are under attack from the establishment parties in Ireland. Freedom of speech is protected under article 40.6.1.i in the Irish constitution ..However, the political establishment wants to strip away your rights with erroneous and misguided laws. The disastrous Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan recently launched a public consultation on ‘hate speech’ with a view to implementing laws that will clamp down on your ability to speak your mind on the issues of the day. He also wants to introduce ‘hate crime’ legislation which would have very serious repercussions for our legal and justice system. Hate crime laws would mean a two tier legal system and undermine the principle of equality before the law. For example, crimes against ordinary members of the public would be treated less seriously than crimes against members of a minority group where hate is perceived to be the motivating factor.",

Opposition to Mass Immigration and a Commitment to Remigration The National Party supports the ending of all mass immigration into Ireland. Further, we support a positive policy of remigration in order to secure Ireland as the homeland of the Irish people. Central to this commitment to remigration is the Party’s focus on encouraging and incentivising the return of exiled members of the Irish nation, as well as primarily utilising the diaspora as a source for any potential labour shortfalls.",

We stand against the corrupt and amoral establishment who push replacement level immigration which will in time completely destroy Irish nationality. We stand against the project of a federated European Superstate which is explicitly anti-national and therefore anti-Irish. And most of all we stand against the decay of national spirit at the heart of our society.",

        "leg_one_2": "POLITICAL PARTICIPATION: These parties have attracted a segment of the population that may feel disenfranchised or neglected by the traditional political establishment.

        "summary": "The rise of far-right parties in Ireland has had a complex impact, bringing both positive and negative influences to the political landscape. On the positive side, they have broadened the political debate, engaged previously disengaged voters, and challenged mainstream policies. However, the negative effects, including increased social division, potential harm to Ireland’s international reputation, and distraction from broader issues, are significant concerns. As these parties continue to gain influence, the challenge for Irish society will be to address the underlying issues that fuel their rise while maintaining social cohesion, trust in democratic institutions, and a commitment to inclusive, evidence-based policymaking."

The impact of Independents is a double-edged sword: they can be both a force for positive change and a source of political fragmentation and instability. To counteract this effect many Independents have chosen to form groups such as The Rural Independents (a group of six), The Regional Independents (a group of nine),  Independent Group (6) and Independent4Change (2). These groupings enable Independents with similar policies and principles to vote as a block."
